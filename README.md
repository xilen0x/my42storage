# libft | 42 BCN
*Your first library*

## Summary
In this project we'll be implementing our home-made functions from libc, which will be very useful to get familiar with memory allocation, and to think of creative ways to code these functions.

## Projects Overview

| ``libft`` | In this project I have implemented my own version of some of the main libc functions. Libft is a C library that provides a set of essential functions commonly used in programming. It includes functions for character and string manipulation, memory handling, and more. Additionally, it offers linked list operations. These functions aim to facilitate C programming tasks. |
